## Usage Examples

### 1. Email Processing

```php
use App\Jobs\SendEmailJob;
use App\Services\QueueService;

// Send high priority email
$queueService = app(QueueService::class);
$mailable = new OrderConfirmationMail($order);
$queueService->dispatchHighPriority(
    new SendEmailJob($mailable, $user->email, 'order_confirmation'),
    QueueService::QUEUE_EMAIL
);

// Send low priority newsletter
$queueService->dispatchLowPriority(
    new SendEmailJob($newsletter, $user->email, 'newsletter'),
    QueueService::QUEUE_EMAIL
);
```

### 2. Push Notifications

```php
use App\Jobs\SendNotificationJob;

// Send order update notification
$notificationData = [
    'title' => 'Order Update',
    'body' => 'Your order has been shipped!',
    'data' => ['order_id' => $order->id]
];

dispatch(new SendNotificationJob(
    $notificationData,
    $fcmTokens,
    'order_update'
));
```

### 3. Report Generation

```php
use App\Jobs\GenerateReportJob;

// Generate sales report
dispatch(new GenerateReportJob(
    'sales_report',
    [
        'start_date' => '2024-01-01',
        'end_date' => '2024-01-31',
        'branch_id' => 1
    ],
    auth()->id(),
    'admin@grofresh.com'
));
```

### 4. Data Processing

```php
use App\Jobs\ProcessDataJob;

// Bulk product update
$productData = [
    ['id' => 1, 'price' => 25.99],
    ['id' => 2, 'price' => 15.50],
    // ... more products
];

dispatch(new ProcessDataJob(
    'bulk_product_update',
    $productData,
    ['batch_size' => 100]
));
```

## Queue Management Commands

### 1. Start Queue Workers

```bash
# Start default worker
php artisan queue:work

# Start worker with specific queues (priority order)
php artisan queue:work --queue=high,emails_high,notifications_high,default,emails,notifications,reports,images,data,low

# Start worker with memory limit
php artisan queue:work --memory=512

# Start worker with timeout
php artisan queue:work --timeout=60
```

### 2. Monitor Queues

```bash
# Show queue overview
php artisan queue:monitor

# Show detailed statistics
php artisan queue:monitor --stats

# Show failed jobs
php artisan queue:monitor --failed

# Show worker status
php artisan queue:monitor --workers
```

### 3. Manage Failed Jobs

```bash
# Retry specific failed job
php artisan queue:monitor --retry=123

# Retry multiple failed jobs
php artisan queue:monitor --retry=123,124,125

# Clear all failed jobs
php artisan queue:monitor --clear-failed

# Retry all failed jobs
php artisan queue:retry all
```

### 4. Queue Maintenance

```bash
# Restart all workers
php artisan queue:restart

# Clear all jobs from queue
php artisan queue:clear

# Flush all failed jobs
php artisan queue:flush
```

## Production Deployment

### 1. Supervisor Configuration

Create `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/grofresh-worker.conf`:

```ini
[program:grofresh-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /path/to/grofresh/artisan queue:work --queue=high,emails_high,notifications_high,default,emails,notifications,reports,images,data,low --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
user=www-data
numprocs=4
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/path/to/grofresh/storage/logs/worker.log
stopwaitsecs=3600
```

### 2. Start Supervisor

```bash
# Update supervisor configuration
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update

# Start workers
sudo supervisorctl start grofresh-worker:*

# Check status
sudo supervisorctl status
```

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

**Log Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor worker logs
tail -f storage/logs/worker.log

# Monitor Laravel logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

**Health Checks:**
- Monitor queue depth to prevent backlog
- Track failed job rates
- Monitor worker memory usage
- Set up alerts for critical failures

## Database Tables

### Jobs Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    queue VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    payload LONGTEXT NOT NULL,
    attempts TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    reserved_at INT UNSIGNED NULL,
    available_at INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    created_at INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    INDEX jobs_queue_index (queue)
);
```

### Failed Jobs Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE failed_jobs (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    uuid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    connection TEXT NOT NULL,
    queue TEXT NOT NULL,
    payload LONGTEXT NOT NULL,
    exception LONGTEXT NOT NULL,
    failed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Job Design

**Keep Jobs Small and Focused:**
- Single responsibility principle
- Avoid complex dependencies
- Make jobs idempotent when possible
- Handle failures gracefully

**Error Handling:**
- Implement proper try-catch blocks
- Log meaningful error messages
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Set appropriate timeout values

### 2. Queue Management

**Priority Assignment:**
- High: Critical user-facing operations
- Normal: Standard business operations
- Low: Background maintenance tasks

**Resource Management:**
- Monitor memory usage
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Use batch processing for large datasets
- Implement circuit breakers for external services

### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance

**Regular Monitoring:**
- Queue depth and processing rates
- Failed job rates and patterns
- Worker health and performance
- Resource utilization

**Maintenance Tasks:**
- Regular cleanup of old jobs
- Failed job analysis and resolution
- Performance optimization
- Capacity planning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workers Not Processing Jobs:**
1. Check if workers are running: `php artisan queue:monitor --workers`
2. Verify queue configuration: `config/queue.php`
3. Check database connectivity
4. Review worker logs for errors

**High Failed Job Rate:**
1. Analyze failed job patterns: `php artisan queue:monitor --failed`
2. Check external service availability
3. Review timeout settings
4. Verify job logic and dependencies

**Memory Issues:**
1. Monitor worker memory usage
2. Adjust memory limits in supervisor config
3. Optimize job memory usage
4. Implement job chunking for large datasets

**Performance Issues:**
1. Monitor queue depth and processing rates
2. Scale worker processes as needed
3. Optimize database queries in jobs
4. Consider Redis for high-throughput scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Features

**Planned Improvements:**
- Job scheduling and cron integration
- Advanced retry strategies
- Job chaining and workflows
- Real-time queue monitoring dashboard
- Automatic scaling based on queue depth

### 2. Integration Enhancements

**Additional Integrations:**
- Redis Cluster for high availability
- Message queue systems (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)
- Monitoring tools (New Relic, DataDog)
- Alerting systems (Slack, PagerDuty)
- Performance analytics and optimization

## Conclusion

The queue management system provides significant improvements in application responsiveness, reliability, and scalability. The modular design allows for easy customization and extension based on specific application needs.

Regular monitoring and maintenance ensure optimal performance and help identify optimization opportunities as the application scales.
